#!/usr/local/bin/checkio --domain=py run ghosts-age

# Nicola takes a moment to study the ghosts. He is trying to think up a new method to determine just how old these ghosts are.    He knows that their age is somehow related to their opacity. To measure their opacity Nikola uses a scale of 10000 units to 0 units,    where 10000 is a completely opaque newborn ghost (0 years old) and 0 is completely transparent ghost (of an unknown age).
# 
# After some experimenting, Nikola thinks he has discovered the law of ghostly opacity.    On every birthday, a ghost's opacity is reduced by a number of units equal to its age    when its age is a Fibonacci number (Read about this here)    or increased by 1 if it is not.
# 
# For example:
# A newborn ghost -- 10000 units of opacity.
# 1 year -- 10000 - 1 = 9999 (1 is a Fibonacci number).
# 2 year -- 9999 - 2 = 9997 (2 is a Fibonacci number).
# 3 year -- 9997 - 3 = 9994 (3 is a Fibonacci number).
# 4 year -- 9994 + 1 = 9995 (4 is not a Fibonacci number).
# 5 year -- 9995 - 5 = 9990 (5 is a Fibonacci number).
# 
# 
# Help Nicola write a function which will determine the age of a ghost based on its opacity.    You are given opacity measurements as a number ranging from 0 to 10000 inclusively.    The ghosts cannot be older than 5000 years as they simply disappear after such a long time (really!).
# 
# This is a Halloween task so you should try and write a "magic" or "scary" solution. Please, do not write "regular" solution.
# 
# Input:An opacity measurement as an integer.
# 
# Output:The age of the ghost as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:
# age < 5000
# 0 < opacity â‰¤ 10000
