#!/usr/local/bin/checkio --domain=py run striped-words

# Our robots are always working to improve their linguistic skills.    For this mission, they research the latin alphabet and its applications.
# 
# The alphabet contains both vowel and consonant letters (yes, we divide the letters).
# Vowels --A E I O U Y
# Consonants --B C D F G H J K L M N P Q R S T V W X Z
# 
# You are given a block of text with different words.     These words are separated by white-spaces and punctuation marks.    Numbers are not considered words in this mission (a mix of letters and digits is not a word either).    You should count the number of words (striped words) where the vowels with consonants are alternating,    that is; words that you count cannot have two consecutive vowels or consonants.    The words consisting of a single letter are not striped -- do not count those. Casing is not significant for this mission.
# 
# Input:A text as a string (unicode)
# 
# Output:A quantity of striped words as an integer.
# 
# Precondition:The text contains only ASCII symbols.
# 0 < len(text) < 105
