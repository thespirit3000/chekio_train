# You need to figure if a wellfounded and wellsized iterable is completely empty.
# 
# An iterablex0is wellfounded if there is no infinite sequencex1,x2,x3...such that... in x3 in x2 in x1 in x0(whereinis meant iteratively,x(n+1)will be encountered while iterating throughxn).
# 
# A wellfounded iterable is wellsized if it has only finitely many iterable elements, and all of them are wellsized.
# 
# A wellfounded iterable is completely empty when all its elements are completely empty.
# 
# Some consequences of the above definitions:
# 
# any empty iterable is completely emptya non-iterable is never completely emptythe only wellfounded string is'', and it is completely emptybytes, and (possibly nested) tuples/frozensets of them are always wellfounded and wellsized{'': 'Nonempty'}is a wellfounded and completely empty iterableafterc=[];c.append(c), c is a non-wellfounded iterableitertools.repeat(())is wellfounded but not wellsizeditertools.repeat(5)is wellfounded and wellsizedInput:A wellfounded and wellsized iterable.
