# We have some horse racing statistics  (each horse’s time in each race)
# You have to find the number of the horse which has the most wins.
# For example: if the results are [[“1:13”, “1:26”, “1:11”], [“1:10”, “1:18”, “1:14”], [“1:20”, “1:23”, “1:15”]] then the 3rd horse is the fastest, because it has won 2 races out of 3.
# Every element in the list - is a string in format m:ss, for example, "1:05" or "2:22". 1:00<= time<= 5:00
# 
# 
# 
# Input:Racing time as an array of arrays.
# 
# Output:The number of the fastest horse that has the most wins (Important: in this task the horse numbers starts from "1", not from "0")
# 
# Precondition:
# 2<= horses<= 10
# 1<= races<= 10
# 1:00<= time<= 5:00
# There is only 1 fastest horse in each test
#
